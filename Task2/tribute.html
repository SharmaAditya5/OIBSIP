            <h3>Biography</h3>

                Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, and other Indian languages, he performed in Odia, Bengali, Assamese,
                and Gujarati. Krishnakumar Kunnath, better known as KK, was born in Delhi, India, on August 23, 1968. Mount
                St. Mary’s School in Delhi was where he received his primary education and where he grew up. He graduated
                from Kirori Mal College in Delhi with a bachelor’s degree in business.</p>

                        <h4>Early Life</h4>
                        <p>Let us tell you that when KK was a kid, he wanted to be a doctor. In his early twenties, at the age
                            of twelve, he had his first public performance. The public adored his voice, and as a result, several
                            Delhi-based marketing firms began to employ his talents. In addition, he and a few of his pals started
                            a rock band. KK formerly worked in the hotel sector as a marketing executive before relocating to Mumbai.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h4> Bollywood Career</h4>
                        <p>Loius Banks, Ranjit Barot and Lesle Lewis took notice of KK’s demo tape and offered him an opportunity to enter
                             the music business. After that, he began to sing jingles. When he sang a jingle for a Santogen Suiting commercial,
                              UTV saw him and contacted him.
                              In four years, he sang more than 3500 jingles in 11 languages. UTV for jingles was his first big break in Mumbai.
                               When Lesle Lewis gave him his first Indian jingle and his entrance into Bollywood, he considered her a mentor.

                              But it was AR Rahman who made KK a household name in the world of film soundtracks. From Kadir’s Kadhal Desam,
                               he sang “Kalluri Saaley” and “Hello Dr.” before moving on to “Strawberry Kannae” from AVM Productions’ musical
                                film Minsara Kanavu.
                              
                              TADAP TADAP from Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s HUM, DIL DE CHUKKE SANM by KK smashed every set record in 1999. His
                               previous work included singing Gulzar’s Chhod Aye Hum from the film Maachis, although it received little acclaim.
                                Sony Music also submitted KK searching for a new singer that year. His debut solo album, Pal with Lesle Lewis,
                                 was released after being named the year’s top talent.</p>
